# Paolo G. Giarrusso's phd-thesis

The version handed in for review is tagged `aug-2017-handin-2`. Changes that are
editorial or to sources are in the `master` branch.

Branch `errata` accumulates errata since then.

Branch `layout` accumulates layout changes on top of the errata.

***Warning***: I often rebase branches `layout` and `errata` on `master`, so
beware if pulling!
