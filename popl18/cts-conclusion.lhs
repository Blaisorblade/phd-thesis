\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have presented a program transformation which turns a functional
program into its derivative and efficiently shares redundant
computations between them thanks to a statically computed
cache. Although our first practical case studies show promising
results, it remains now to integrate this transformation into a
realistic compiler.
