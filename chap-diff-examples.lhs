\chapter{A tour of differentiation examples}
\label{ch:diff-examples}
Before formalizing ILC, we show more example of change structures and
primitives, to show (a) designs for reusable primitives and their
derivatives, (b) to what extent we can incrementalize basic building
blocks such as recursive functions and algebraic data types, and (c) to sketch how
we can incrementalize collections efficiently.

To describe these examples informally, we use Haskell notation and let
polymorphism as appropriate (see \cref{sec:intro-stlc}).
% We already sketch, how a change structure
% can be represented in Haskell terms:

We also motivate a few extensions to differentiation that we describe later. As
we'll see in this chapter, we'll need to enable some forms of introspection on
function changes to manipulate the embedded environments, as we discuss in
\cref{ch:defunc-fun-changes}. We will also need ways to remember intermediate
results, which we will discuss in \cref{part:caching}.

\section{Change structures as typeclass instances}
We encode change structure
as a \emph{type class} named |ChangeStruct|. An instance |ChangeStruct t|
defines a change type |Dt^t| as an associated type and operations |`oplus`|,
|`ominus`| and |`ocompose`| are defined as methods.
\begin{code}
class ChangeStruct t where
  type Dt^t
  oplus :: t -> Dt t -> t
  ominus :: t -> t -> Dt t
  (`ocompose`) :: Dt t -> Dt t -> Dt t
  nilc :: t -> Dt t
\end{code}
In this chapter we will
often show change structures where only some methods are defined; in actual
implementations we use a type class hierarchy to encode what operations are
available, but we collapse this hierarchy here to simplify presentation.
% We'll come back to this definition and refine it,
% describing the laws it satisfies, in \cref{sec:change-struct-tc}.

\pg{Too short for a section. Add sums and products maybe?}
\section{How to design a language plugin}
\label{sec:plugin-design}

When adding support for a datatype |T|, we will strive to
define both a change structure and derivatives of introduction and
elimination forms for |T|, since such forms constitute a complete API
for using that datatype. However, we will sometimes have to restrict
elimination forms to scenarios that can be incrementalized efficiently. We will
also use overly simplified change structures to illustrate a few points.

\pg{Put somewhere:}
In general, to differentiate a primitive |f : A -> B| once we have defined a
change structure for |A|, we can start by defining |df a1 da = f a2
`ominus` f a1|, assume |da| is a valid change from |a1| to |a2|, and try to
simplify and rewrite the expression in terms of |a1| and |da| to avoid using
|`ominus`| as far as possible. In fact, instead of defining |`ominus`| and
simplifying |f a2 `ominus` f a1| to not use it, it is sufficient to produce a
change from |f a1| to |f a2|, even a different one. We write |da1 `doe` da2| to
mean that changes |da1| and |da2| are equivalent, that is they have the same
source and destination. We define this concept properly in~\cref{sec:change-equivalence}.

We try to avoid running |`ominus`| on arguments of non-constant size, since it
might easily take time linear or superlinear in the argument sizes; if
|`ominus`| produces replacement values, it completes in constant time but
derivatives invoked on the produced changes are not efficient.
%implement it on lists to produce a minimal-size difference,\citep{Cormen2001}.
% Running |`ominus`| can take time linear on input sizes, or worse: If we wanted
% to find a minimal description of a change between lists,

\section{Incrementalizing a collection API}
In this section, we describe a collection API that we incrementalize in this chapter.

To avoid notation conflicts, we represent lists via
datatype |List a|, defined as follows:
\begin{code}
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
\end{code}

We also consider as primitive operation a standard mapping function |map|.
We also support two restricted forms of aggregation:
(a) folding over a group via
|fold|, similar to how one usually folds over a monoid;\footnote{\url{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.1.0/docs/Data-Foldable.html}.}
(b) list concatenation via |concat|. We will not discuss how to differentiate
|concat|, as we reuse existing solutions by \citet{Firsov2016purely}.
\begin{code}
singleton :: a -> List a
singleton x = Cons x Nil

map :: (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
map f Nil = Nil
map f (Cons x xs) = Cons (f x) (map f xs)

fold :: GroupChangeStruct b => List b -> b
fold Nil = mempty
fold (Cons x xs) = x `mappend` fold xs -- Where |`mappend`| is infix for |mappend|.

concat :: List (List a) -> List a
concat = ...
\end{code}
While usually |fold| requires only an instance |Monoid b| of type class |Monoid| to aggregate
collection elements, our variant of |fold| requires an instance of type class |GroupChangeStruct|, a
subclass of |Monoid|. This typeclass is not used by |fold| itself, but only by
its derivative, as we explain in \cref{sec:incr-fold}; nevertheless,
we add this stronger constraint to |fold| itself because we forbid derivatives
with stronger typeclass constraints. With this approach, all clients of |fold|
can be incrementalized using differentiation.

Using those primitives, one can define further higher-order functions on
collections such as |concatMap|, |filter|, |foldMap|. In turn, these functions
form the kernel of a collection API, as studied for instance by work on the
\emph{monoid comprehension calculus}~\citep{Grust96Monoid,Fegaras95,Fegaras99},
even if they are not complete by themselves.
\begin{code}
concatMap :: (a -> List b) -> List a -> List b
concatMap f = concat . map f

filter :: (a -> Bool) -> List a -> List a
filter p = concatMap (\x -> if p x then singleton x else Nil)

foldMap :: GroupChangeStruct b => (a -> b) -> List a -> b
foldMap f = fold . map f
\end{code}
In first-order DSLs such as SQL, such functionality must typically be added through separate
primitives (consider for instance |filter|), while here we can simply
\emph{define}, for instance, |filter| on top of |concatMap|, and incrementalize
the resulting definitions using differentiation.

Function |filter| uses conditionals, which we haven't discussed yet; we show how
to incrementalize |filter| successfully in \cref{sec:chs-sums}.\pg{Do it!}

\section{Incrementalizing aggregation}
\label{sec:incr-fold}
\pg{We are using abelian groups!}
Let's now discuss how to incrementalize |fold|.
We consider an oversimplified change structure that
allows only two sorts of changes: prepending an element to a list or removing
the list head of a non-empty list, and study how to incrementalize |fold| for
such changes:

\begin{code}
data ListChange a = Prepend a | Remove
instance ChangeStruct (List a) where
  type Dt^(List a) = ListChange a
  xs `oplus` Prepend x = Cons x xs
  (Cons x xs) `oplus` Remove = xs
  Nil `oplus` Remove = error "Invalid change"

dfold xs (Prepend x) = ...
\end{code}
Removing an element from an empty list is an invalid change, hence it is safe to
give an error in that scenario as mentioned when introducing |`oplus`|
(\cref{sec:change-intro}).

Equational reasoning shows that |dfold xs (Prepend x)| should be a change that,
in a sense, ``adds'' |x| to the result using group operations:
\begin{equational}
\begin{code}
      dfold xs (Prepend x)
`doe`
      fold (xs `oplus` Prepend x) `ominus` fold xs
=
      fold (Cons x xs) `ominus` fold xs
=
      (x `mappend` fold xs) `ominus` fold xs
\end{code}
\end{equational}
Similarly, |dfold (Cons x xs) Remove| should instead ``subtract'' |x| from the result:

\begin{equational}
\begin{code}
      dfold (Cons x xs) Remove
`doe`
      fold (Cons x xs `oplus` Remove) `ominus` fold (Cons x xs)
=
      fold xs `ominus` fold (Cons x xs)
=
      fold xs `ominus` (x `mappend` fold xs)
\end{code}
\end{equational}
To avoid using |`ominus`| we must rewrite its invocation to an equivalent expression.
In this scenario we can use group changes, and restrict |fold| to
situations where such changes are available.

\begin{code}
dfold :: GroupChangeStruct b => List b -> Dt (List b) -> Dt b
dfold xs (Prepend x) = inject x
dfold (Cons x xs) Remove = inject (invert x)
dfold Nil Remove = error "Invalid change"
\end{code}

To support group changes we define the following type classes to model groups
and group change structures. |GroupChangeStruct| only requires that group
elements of type |g| can be converted into changes (type |Dt^g|), allowing
change type |Dt^g| to contain other sorts of changes.
\begin{code}
class Monoid g => Group g where
  invert :: g -> g
class (Group a, ChangeStruct a) => GroupChangeStruct a where
  -- Inject group elements into changes. Laws:
  -- |a `oplus` inject b = a `mappend` b|
  inject :: a -> Dt a
\end{code}

\Cref{sec:applying} discusses how
we can use so without assuming a single group is defined on elements, but here we
simply select the canonical group as chosen by typeclass resolution. To use a
different group, as usual, one defines a different but isomorphic type via the
Haskell |newtype| construct. As a downside, derivatives |newtype| constructors
must convert changes across different representations.

\section{Simple changes on lists}
\label{sec:simple-changes-list-map}
In this section, we consider a basic change structure on lists and the
derivative of |map|, and we sketch informally its correctness. We prove it
formally in \cref{ex:syn-changes-map}.

We can then represent changes to a list (|List a|) as a list of changes (|List
(Dt^a)|), one for each element.
A list change |dxs| is valid for source |xs| if
they have the same length and each element change is valid for
its corresponding element.
For this change structure we can define |`oplus`| and
|`ocompose`|, but not a total |`ominus`|: such list changes can't express the
difference between two lists of different lengths.
% We discuss
% product and sum types more in general in \cref{ch:prod-sums}.
Nevertheless, this change structure is sufficient to define
derivatives that act correctly on the changes that can be expressed.
We can describe this change structure in Haskell using a
typeclass instance for class |ChangeStruct|:
\begin{code}
instance ChangeStruct (List a) where
  type Dt^(List a) = List (Dt^a)
  Nil `oplus` Nil = Nil
  (Cons x xs) `oplus` (Cons dx dxs) = Cons (x `oplus` xs) (dx `oplus` dxs)
  _ `oplus` _ = Nil
\end{code}

The following |dmap| function is a derivative for the
standard |map| function (included for reference) and the given
change structure. We discuss derivatives for recursive functions
in \cref{sec:general-recursion}.
\begin{code}
map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
map f Nil = Nil
map f (Cons x xs) = Cons (f x) (map f xs)

dmap : (a -> b) -> Dt^(a -> b) -> List a -> Dt^List a -> Dt^List b
-- A valid list change has the same length as the base list:
dmap f df Nil Nil = Nil
dmap f df (Cons x xs) (Cons dx dxs) =
  Cons (df x dx) (dmap f df xs dxs)
-- Remaining cases deal with invalid changes, and a dummy
-- result is sufficient.
dmap f df xs dxs = Nil
\end{code}
Function |dmap| is a correct derivative of |map| for this change structure,
according to \cref{slogan:derive}: we sketch an informal argument by induction.
The equation for |dmap f df Nil Nil| returns |Nil|, a valid change from initial
to updated outputs, as required.
In the equation for |dmap f df (Cons x xs) (Cons dx dxs)| we compute changes to
the head and tail of the result, to produce a change from
|map f (Cons x xs)| to |map (f `oplus` df) (Cons x xs `oplus` Cons dx dxs)|. To
this end,
(a) we use |df x dx| to compute a
change to the head of the result, from |f x| to |(f `oplus` df) (x `oplus` dx)|;
(b) we use |dmap f df xs dxs| recursively to compute a change to the tail of the
result, from |map f xs| to |map (f `oplus` df) (xs `oplus` dxs)|;
(c) we assemble changes to head and tail with |Cons| into a change from
In other words, |dmap| turns input changes to output changes correctly according
to our \cref{slogan:derive}: it is a correct derivative for |map| according to
this change structure.
We have reasoned informally; we formalize this
style of reasoning in \cref{sec:denot-syntactic-reasoning}. Crucially, our
conclusions only hold if input changes are valid, hence term |map f xs `oplus` dmap f
df xs dxs| is not denotationally equal to |map (f `oplus` df) (xs `oplus` dxs)|
for arbitrary change environments:
these two terms only evaluate to the same result for valid input changes.

Since this definition of |dmap| is a correct derivative, we could use it in an incremental DSL for
list manipulation, together with other primitives. Because of limitations we
describe next, we will use instead improved language plugins for sequences.

\subsection{Limitations}
We have shown simplified list changes, but they have a few limitations. Fixing
those requires more sophisticated definitions.

As discussed, our list changes intentionally forbid changing the length of a list.
And our definition of |dmap| has further limitations: a change to a list of $n$
elements takes size $O(n)$, even when most elements do not change, and calling
|dmap f df| on it requires $n$ calls to |df|. This is only faster if |df| is
faster than |f|, but adds no further speedup.

We can describe instead a change to an arbitrary list element |x| in |xs| by
giving the change |dx| and the position of |x| in |xs|. A list change is then a
sequence of such changes:
\begin{code}
type Dt^(List a) = List (AtomicChange a)
data AtomicChange a = Modify Int (Dt^a)
\end{code}
However, fetching the |i|-th list element still takes time linear in |i|: we
need a better representation of sequences. In next section, we switch to a change structure
on sequences defined by finger trees~\citep{hinze2006finger},
following \citet{Firsov2016purely}.

\section{Efficient sequence changes}
\citet{Firsov2016purely} define an efficient representation of list changes in a
framework similar to ILC, and incrementalize selected operations over this change
structure. They also provide combinators to assemble further operations on top
of the provided ones.
We extend their framework to handle function changes and generate derivatives
for all functions that can be expressed in terms of the primitives.

\pg{Consider resuming here}
%\pg{Code size for snippets?}
Conceptually, a change for type |Sequence a| is a sequence of atomic changes.
Each atomic change inserts one element at a given position, or removes one
element, or changes an element at one
position.\footnote{\citet{Firsov2016purely} and our implementation allow.}
% data AtomicChange a
%   =  Insert Int a
%   |  Delete Int
%   |  ShiftAt
%   |  ChangeAt Int (Dt^a)
\begin{code}
data SeqSingleChange a
  =  Insert    { idx :: Int, x :: a }
  |  Remove    { idx :: Int }
  |  ChangeAt  { idx :: Int, dx :: Dt ^ a }
data SeqChange a = Sequence (SeqSingleChange a)
type Dt (Sequence a) = SeqChange a

\label{sec:differentiation-fold-example}
\pg{write}
% Referenced later in sec-performance.tex by saying:
% % We have seen in \cref{ssec:differentiation} that $\Derivative$
% % needlessly recomputes $\Merge\Xs\Ys$. However, the result is a
% % base input to $\FOLD'$.
\section{Products}
\label{sec:chs-products-intro}
It is also possible to define change structures for arbitrary sum and product
types, and to provide derivatives for introduction and elimination forms for
such datatypes. In this section we discuss products, in the next section sums.

We define a simple change structure for product type |A `times` B| from change
structures for |A| and |B|, similar to change structures for environments:
operations act pointwise on the two components.
\begin{code}
instance (ChangeStruct a, ChangeStruct b) => ChangeStruct (a, b) where
  type Dt^(a, b) = (Dt^a, Dt^b)
  oplus (a, b) (da, db) = (oplus a da, oplus b db)
  nil (a, b) = (nil a, nil b)
  (da1, db1) `ocompose` (da2, db2) = (da1 `ocompose` da2, db1 `ocompose` db2)
\end{code}
We can also define derivatives for the basic primitives on product types, both
the introduction form (that we alias as |pair|) and the elimination forms |fst|
and |snd|.
% ∆⨟
\begin{code}
pair a b = (a, b)
dpair a da b db = (da, db)

fst (a, b) = a
snd (a, b) = b
dfst :: Dt (a, b) -> Dt a
dfst (da, db) = da
dsnd :: Dt (a, b) -> Dt b
dsnd (da, db) = db

uncurry :: (a -> b -> c) -> (a, b) -> c
uncurry f (a, b) = f a b
duncurry :: (a -> b -> c) -> Dt (a -> b -> c) -> (a, b) -> Dt (a, b) -> Dt c
duncurry _f df (x, y) (dx, dy) = df x dx y dy
\end{code}

One can also define $n$-ary products in a similar way. However, a product change
contains as many entries as a product.\pg{Sketch alternatives.}

\section{Sums}
\label{sec:chs-sums}
Changes structures for sums are more challenging. We can define them, but in
many cases we can do better with specialized structures.
\begin{code}
data EitherChange a b = LeftC (Dt a) | RightC (Dt b) | EitherReplace (Either a b)
oplusEither
  :: (ChangeStruct a, ChangeStruct b) =>
     Either a b -> EitherChangeBase a b -> Either a b
(Left a) `oplusEitherBase` (LeftC da) = Left (a `oplus` da)
(Right b) `oplusEitherBase` (RightC db) = Right (b `oplus` db)
(Left _) `oplusEitherBase` (RightC _) = error "Invalid change!"
(Right _) `oplusEitherBase` (LeftC _) = error "Invalid change!"

instance (ChangeStruct a, ChangeStruct b) => ChangeStruct (Either a b) where
  type Dt (Either a b) = Replace (Either a b) (EitherChangeBase a b)
  oplus = oplusEither
  oreplace = EitherReplace

instance (NilChangeStruct a, NilChangeStruct b) => NilChangeStruct (Either a b) where
  nil (Left a) = Ch $ LeftC (nil a)
  nil (Right a) = Ch $ RightC (nil a)
\end{code}
\pg{Add |either| and |deither|!}

\paragraph{Extensions}
Unfortunately, with this change structure a change from |Left a1| to |Right b2|
is simply a replacement change, so derivatives processing it must recompute
results from scratch. Could we do better?
In general no, since there need be no shared data between two
branches of a datatype.
But in some cases types |a| and |b| are related. Take again lists: a change from
list |as| to list |Cons a2 as| should simply say that we prepend |a2| to the
list. In a sense, we are just using a change structure from type |List a| to |a
`times` List a|.
More in general, if change |das| from |as1| to |as2| is small, a change from
list |as1| to list |Cons a2 as2| should simply ``say'' that we prepend |a2| and
that we modify |as1| into |as2|.
With a better way to describe a change from values of type |a| to
values of type |b|,
\pg{Later we sketch change structures across types.}

\pg{Idea: |ChangeStruct2 t1 t2, Iso t2 t3) => ChangeStruct2 t1 t3|}
% Lists can be described as the fixpoint of a sum of
% product: |List a = mu X. 1 + A `times` X|

\section{Chapter conclusion}
In this chapter we have toured what can and cannot be incrementalized using
differentiation, and how using higher-order functions allows defining generic
primitives to incrementalize.
